Description:
To-do is a dynamic mobile application for the management of daily tasks. The application will allow users to insert, update, read, and delete tasks by changing priorities, 
including dates,and sorting those tasks accordingly. It is built using Android Studio and Kotlin. It will use a modern architecture that utilizes Room for the persistence of data, 
Kotlin Coroutines for the implementation of asynchronous operations, and RecyclerView to display the tasks in a scrollable list. The View Model architecture separates the UI from the business logic,
making applications more performant and responsive.
